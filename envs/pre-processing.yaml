# Used for the preparation step, that in the demo pipeline is done outside of Snakemake. See
# https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-gatk-variant-calling/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml
# for the steps that they run beforhand. This produces index files that we need so that our
# rule DAG can be built. We hence incorporate the necessary steps directly into our pipeline,
# for full comfort, see rules/prep.smk
